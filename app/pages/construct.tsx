          <h2 className="textAlignCenter">New to making crosswords?</h2>
          <p>
            Don’t be intimidated! Constructing great crosswords takes a lot of
            practice, but it’s easy to get started. When you first launch the
            constructor, Crosshare defaults you to a 5x5 mini grid (to create a
            different sized puzzle click on “More” in the top bar and then click
            “New Puzzle”). Mini puzzles are a great way to get started because
            you don’t need to worry so much about the grid layout - you just
            need to focus on getting fill you like and coming up with fun clues.
          </p>
          <h3>Filling the grid</h3>
          <p>
            After launching the constructor, click anywhere in the grid and
            start typing your first fill entry. As you type you’ll notice the
            Crosshare autofiller magically fills in the rest of the grid. You
            shouldn’t rely exclusively on the autofiller - the wordlist(s)
            beside the grid give you other options for the currently selected
            entry. You can also use any other word you like even if it’s not in
            the list - it’s all COVFEFE.
          </p>
          <h3>Using black squares</h3>
          <p>
            You can create a black square by typing the ‘.’ key on your keyboard
            or hitting the all black key on the keyboard if you’re on a mobile
            device. Select the square and hit ‘.’ or type any letter to toggle
            it back. Placing black squares is an art form for larger grids. This{' '}

            does a pretty good job of introducing some of the ideas behind where
            they should go.
          </p>
          <h3>Finalizing the grid</h3>
          <p>
            It can take a lot of tweaking to get a grid that you’re happy with.
            Maybe you really want to work a specific word in but every time you
            try it makes for poor (or no!) choices elsewhere. The best thing to
            do is to try to stay flexible and keep playing with different
            options until it all clicks. The Crosshare autofiller can help this
            along by showing you different candidate fills - every time you
            press the ‘Enter’ key (or click ‘Rerun Autofill’ in the top bar)
            you’ll get a slightly different fill.
          </p>
          <h3>Adding clues</h3>
          <p>
            Once your grid is filled in click the “Clues” button in the top bar
            to go to the clue view. You’ll see every word in your grid with an
            input next to it for your clue. Try to come up with your own
            interesting clue for each word. It’s important to have some easier
            clues (especially on mini puzzles!) so that solvers have a place to
            start. This{' '}

            to see how other constructors have clued them. The only way to get
            better at cluing, though, is to force yourself to come up with some
            of your own!
          </p>
          <h3>Publishing</h3>
          <p>
            After all of your clues are filled in, come up with a title for your
            puzzle. This gets entered at the top of the clue view. Now click
            “Back to Grid”, give it one more look, and hit “Publish”. After
            publishing, Crosshare will redirect you to your puzzle’s new home.
            You might want to add a comment (solvers will see it they finish
            solving). When you’re ready, copy the link and share it with as many
            solvers as you can find! As the author, you’ll be able to view solve
            stats for your puzzle - click “More” and then “Stats” from the
            puzzle page.

          <h3>What if I have an existing puzzle I’d like to upload?</h3>
          <p>
            Crosshare supports .puz uploading <Link href="/upload">here</Link>.
          </p>
          <h3>Does Crosshare support rebuses?</h3>
          <p>
            Yup, both the constructor and the solver support entering rebuses -
            hit ‘Escape’ (or ‘Rebus’ on your mobile device keyboard) to enter a
            rebus. The autofiller supports filling around them, too{' '}
            <Emoji symbol="😉" />.
          </p>
          <h3>What about circled / shaded squares?</h3>
          <p>Yup, and yup!</p>
          <h3>How do clue cross-references work?</h3>
          <p>
            When you use something like <i>7-Across</i> or <i>5D</i> in a clue
            it will automatically get linked to the referenced clue. This sets
            up clue highlighting and tooltips for solvers. You can also prefix
            clues with a &lsquo;*&rsquo; and use phrases like &ldquo;the starred
            clues&rdquo; in another clue to set up references to them.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What if my clue uses <i>3D</i> but it&apos;s not supposed to be a
            cross-reference?
          </h3>
          <p>
            You can prefix a clue with &lsquo;!@&rsquo; to tell Crosshare to
            skip it when scanning for clue references. Solvers won&apos;t see
            the !@, obviously.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I use my own wordlist?</h3>
          <p>Custom wordlists / wordlist editing will be released soon.</p>
          <h3>Can I create rectangular grids?</h3>
          <p>
            Yup, you can use any dimensions you want. Better yet, both the
            constructor and solver interfaces optimize around whatever size grid
            you use - to maximize usability on smaller screens.

          <h3>
            Does the constructor work on (iPad / iPhone / Android / Windows / OS
            X / Linux)?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Crosshare constructor should work on any modern browser, and is
            optimized for mobile devices. For the first time you can have a
            first class constructing experience on your iPad. If you have any
            issues on any device, please get in touch and let me know!

          <h3>Can I work on more than one puzzle at a time?</h3>
          <p>
            Saving and loading multiple puzzles is coming soon. In the meantime
            you can use the export/import .puz features to save a local copy of
            a puzzle in progress and then import it again later.
          </p>
          <h3>Will Crosshare ever have an offline mode?</h3>
          <p>
            I know I’m sounding like a broken record, but this is coming soon
            too!
          </p>
          <h3>Can I export my puzzle as a PDF or .puz file?</h3>
          <p>
            You can export a .puz file directly from the constructor. After
            publishing a puzzle both PDF and .puz become available for solvers.
            To get a nicely formatted PDF for printing: click “More” and then
            “Print puzzle”. To download a .puz click “More” and then “Download
            .puz”
